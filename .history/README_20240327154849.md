# RobustCell

# Installation

To use our attack-defense framework, the users need to install the following packages:

Install [Deeprobust](https://github.com/DSE-MSU/DeepRobust?tab=readme-ov-file) by

```
pip install deeprobust
```

Due to the bugs exisiting in Deeprobust, we highly encourage you to utilize the codes from our repo (known as the folder **Deeprobust**).

Install [PyG](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by

```
conda install pyg -c pyg
```

In addition to train a neural-network-based classifier, the users are encouraged to install [pytorch_lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/) by

```
pip install lightning
```


To run our evaluations based on [scGPT](https://github.com/bowang-lab/scGPT), the users need to install scGPT by

```
pip install scgpt "flash-attn<1.0.5"  # optional, recommended
# As of 2023.09, pip install may not run with new versions of the google orbax package, if you encounter related issues, please use the following command instead:
# pip install scgpt "flash-attn<1.0.5" "orbax<0.1.8"
pip install wandb
```

We also offer a conda environment to install the packages needed for running attack and defense methods, which is known as. This environment can be installed by

```

```

# Tutorial

We offer a simple tutorial for running one attack method shown in the folder **Tutorial**. More cases can be found in the documents from Deeprobust and Adversarial_training.
